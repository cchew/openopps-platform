# Save as Draft


Task creator view:
- User selects "Save draft"
- User stays on editing page.
- User receives notice stating that the draft has been saved.
- Edit page includes "Save draft" and "Submit for review" button.
- Edit Opportunity State
  -  needs to include "Submitted"
- Notification:
  - changing state to "Submitted" should trigger current notification
  - saving as draft for the first time, generates a one time email with a link to the draft -- based on the creation date and the updated date matching  (people really use the email notifications to find direct links to their tasks and as reminders about next steps)
